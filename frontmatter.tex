\begin{abstract}
\gls{spirit} is a novel robotics teleoperation system which overlays the current position and orientation of a vehicle onto previously acquired images.
This research focuses on developing a \gls{spirit}-based user interface for aerial robots.
The proposed method combines \gls{fov} information with state estimation, and selects a suitable image to use as a background.
It works even in a low-throughput environment where video data might suffer, and only requires one camera.

Experiments were conducted to study the efficacy at increasing accuracy while decreasing time and wasted movements.
Participants were tasked with flying a drone to a location above a known target while using the proposed system, and comparing the results with those obtained by flying with a slowed-down onboard camera.

\gls{spirit} significantly improved accuracy from 0.666\,m to 0.284\,m ($\Delta\sym{mean}=0.266\mathrm{\,m}, \sym{effect}=1.053, \mathrm{\gls{ci}}=98.1\%$), and reduced the overall workload by 37.5\% ($p=0.02408, \sym{effect}=-0.978$), especially in the physical, temporal, and performance metrics.
It also significantly improved the users' control and awareness of absolute and relative positioning.
Their self-assessed ability to stay above the target increased by 86.9\% from an average rating of $2.556/7$ to $4.778/7$ ($p=0.00126,\sym{effect}=2.511$).

There were non-significant increases in time and path lengths, but improvements over subsequent runs indicate that these are simply an issue of familiarity with the system.
Further testing is needed to verify the effect of \gls{spirit} on completion time and path length, and its efficacy in various environments.

Overall, the tests were successful, and all participants gave praise for the system, as well as valuable feedback.
