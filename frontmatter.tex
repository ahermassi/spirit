\begin{summary}
  \gls{spirit} is a system which provides an operator with a third-person perspective of a robot with respect to its environment.
  The view is generated by overlaying a \gls{not:3d} model of the robot onto a previously-acquired image, such that the model would be in the \gls{fov} of the image.

  This research focuses on developing a \gls{spirit}-based user interface for aerial robots.
  The proposed method combines \gls{fov} information with state estimation, and selects a suitable image to use as a background.
  This method can work at low bandwidths and framerates, and only requires a single camera.

  Using the proposed interface, the operator's situational awareness can be significantly increased.
