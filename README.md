# SPIRIT (Subimposed Past Image Records Implemented for Teleoperation)

This is my Masters research project.
I built a novel interface for the teleoperation of quadrotors, which allows the operator to have a third-person perspective of flight operations using only pose information and a monocular camera.
In this case, the pose was obtained from a motion capture system, but this can easily be changed.

This repository utilizes a slightly modified version of Driven Data's [data science cookiecutter template](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/).
As a structure used by various projects, it should allow for easier reusability and sharing among groups.
It also helps with the reproducability of the data pipleine, and the collection of all pieces in one place.

The latest release, and the thesis PDF, can be downloaded from [here](../../releases/latest). 

See the repository [wiki](../../wiki) for more details.
