# SPIRIT (Subimposed Past Image Records Implemented for Teleoperation)

This is my Masters research project.
I built a novel interface for the teleoperation of quadrotors, which allows the operator to have a third-person perspective of flight operations using only position information and a monocular camera.


## Components

## Structure
This repository utilizes a slightly modified version of Driven Data's [data science cookiecutter template](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/).
As a structure used by various projects, it should allow for easier reusability and sharing among groups.
It also helps with the reproducability of the data pipleine, and the collection of all pieces in one place.
